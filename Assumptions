Jotting down few assumptions related to Car Parking lot of a mall:

1. There is parking ticket to enter the the parking lot of the mall.
    a. Parking ticket is a paid ticket.
    b. Parking ticket is an unpaid ticket (This is usually just to keep a track of vehicles entering and exiting the mall).
2. There is no parking ticket to enter the parking lot of the mall.
3. There is a sticker/pass given to the officials and store owners who use the same parking lot but do not need the parking ticket.
4. There is no vacancy in the parking lot as the lot is full (Assuming there are total two floors B1 and B2): 
    a. The entire parking lot is full(B1 and B2)
    b. Only first floor is full (B1)
    c. Only second floor is full (B2)

Other assumptions:
1. There is a person giving the parking ticket at the entry of parking lot.
2. There is a person taking back the ticket at the exit of parking lot.
3. There is a person on every floor (B1 and B2) to assist with the parking.
4. There is a counter displayed at the entrance of parking that show available lots.

Note: As the question in the assignment says it is a car parking, I am not considering 2 wheeler parking here. However, I will include 1 scenario where it would make sure the change in counter of 4 wheeler parking lot is unaffacted due to change in 2 wheeler parking lot and vice versa.
